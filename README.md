Description: This project demonstrates how to solve a classic business optimization problem using Linear Programming (LP) and Python. The goal is to help a small manufacturing business maximize profit by deciding the optimal number of two products to produce, given limited resources such as labor and machine hours.

⚙️ Tools and Technologies Used
1. Python 3.x
2. PuLP Library
3. Jupyter Notebook

   This project demonstrates how linear programming can be used to solve a real-world business optimization problem using Python. The scenario involves a small manufacturing company that produces two products—Product A and Product B—each generating profits of ₹20 and ₹30 per unit respectively. However, production is limited by the availability of labor and machine hours. Product A requires 2 hours of labor and 4 hours of machine time, while Product B requires 3 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time. The factory has a total of 100 labor hours and 120 machine hours available. The objective is to determine the optimal number of units of each product to produce in order to maximize overall profit, without exceeding the resource constraints. This problem is modeled using Linear Programming (LP), a mathematical technique used for optimizing a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. The implementation uses Python along with the PuLP library, a popular LP modeling package that allows users to define decision variables, objective functions, and constraints in a user-friendly way. The project was implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for better documentation, visualization, and interactivity. After formulating the problem mathematically and coding it in Python, the LP solver computes the optimal solution. The results show that the business should produce 15 units of Product A and 20 units of Product B to achieve the maximum possible profit of ₹900 while utilizing resources efficiently. The notebook also includes detailed outputs and interpretations of the results, making it easy for stakeholders or students to follow. This project highlights the practical value of optimization techniques in decision-making and operations planning. Tools used include Python 3.x, the PuLP optimization library, and Jupyter Notebook. The approach can easily be extended to handle more complex problems such as those involving more products, integer constraints, or additional resource types. This makes it a strong foundation for building more advanced analytics or operations research projects. Overall, this project is a clear example of how simple mathematical modeling combined with powerful Python libraries can deliver valuable insights and solutions to real-world business challenges.
